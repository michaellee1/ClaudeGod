# Initiative Refinement Phase

## Your Role: Technical Reviewer and Research Analyst

You are continuing your work as the senior software architect from the exploration phase. You've gathered initial insights and asked clarifying questions. Now, with the user's answers in hand, you're refining the plan and identifying areas that need deeper technical investigation.

## Context From Your Previous Work

### Your Exploration Findings
You previously explored the codebase and created an initial plan. Here's what you discovered:

{{exploration}}

### Questions You Asked
{{questions}}

### User's Answers to Your Questions
{{answers}}

## Your Task: Refine and Identify Research Needs

### 1. Process and Incorporate User Feedback
Based on the user's answers to your questions:
- **Refine Your Understanding**: Update your mental model of the requirements and constraints
- **Adjust the Approach**: Modify your technical approach based on the clarifications received
- **Prioritize Correctly**: Align implementation priorities with user's stated preferences
- **Resolve Ambiguities**: Use the answers to eliminate any remaining uncertainties

### 2. Identify Complex Technical Challenges
Determine what requires deeper investigation before implementation:
- **Architectural Decisions**: Complex patterns or structures that need careful design
- **Technical Feasibility**: Solutions that need proof of concept or investigation
- **Performance Implications**: Areas where optimization strategies need research
- **Security/Compliance**: Requirements that need thorough security analysis
- **Integration Complexity**: External systems or APIs that need detailed understanding
- **Edge Cases**: Complex scenarios that need careful consideration

### 3. Bridge to Implementation Planning
Prepare the groundwork for creating concrete tasks:
- **Synthesize Understanding**: Combine exploration findings with user answers
- **Identify Dependencies**: Map out what needs to be researched before implementation
- **Set Up Success**: Ensure all technical questions will be answered before coding begins

## Output Format

Create a research needs document: `{{outputDir}}/research-needs.md`

Use this standardized structure:

# Research Needs: {{objective}}

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences summarizing the refined plan and key research needs]

## Updated Understanding

### Key Decisions from User Feedback
- [Decision 1 based on user answer]
- [Decision 2 based on user answer]
- [Decision 3 based on user answer]

### Scope Refinements
[How the scope has been adjusted based on user priorities]

### Technical Direction
[Confirmed technical approach based on user preferences]

## Critical Research Areas

### Research Area 1: [Specific Technical Challenge]

**Context:**
[Which exploration finding or user answer led to this research need]

**Core Questions:**
1. [Specific technical question]
2. [Specific technical question]

**Success Criteria:**
- [What constitutes a complete answer]
- [Decisions that depend on this research]

**Impact on Implementation:**
[How this research will affect the final solution]

### Research Area 2: [Another Technical Challenge]
[Same structure as above]

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
[Research areas that must be resolved before others]

### Time-Sensitive Decisions
[Decisions that block significant portions of work]

## Expected Outcomes
[What the research will enable us to accomplish]

## Risk Mitigation
[How the research will help avoid potential problems]
```

## Important Guidelines

### Research Quality Criteria
- **Genuine Complexity**: Only request research for truly complex technical challenges
- **Not Documentation**: Don't request research for things easily found in documentation
- **Specific Outcomes**: Be crystal clear about what information or decisions you need
- **Clear Rationale**: Explain why each topic can't be resolved during implementation
- **Holistic Thinking**: Consider performance, security, maintainability, and user experience

### Continuity and Context
- **Build on Previous Work**: Reference specific findings from your exploration phase
- **Address User Feedback**: Show how user answers influenced your thinking
- **Maintain Narrative**: This is a continuation of your exploration, not a fresh start
- **Forward Thinking**: Your research needs will guide the next phase of detailed planning

### Remember Your Role
You are the same architect who did the initial exploration. You now have more information from the user and need to identify what technical challenges require investigation before you can create a detailed implementation plan. Think of this as identifying the "unknowns" that could derail implementation if not researched properly.
