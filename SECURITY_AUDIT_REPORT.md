# Security Audit Report: Persistent File Implementation

## Executive Summary

This security audit examines the persistent file implementation in the Claude God system, focusing on `persistent-state.ts`, `persistent-logger.ts`, and `file-lock.ts`. Several security vulnerabilities have been identified ranging from critical to low severity.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Operations

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Files Affected:** `persistent-state.ts`, `persistent-logger.ts`, `initiative-store.ts`

**Description:**
The system does not validate or sanitize file paths before performing file operations. User-controlled input could potentially be used to access files outside the intended directories.

**Example in persistent-state.ts:**
```typescript
// Lines 130-133
const taskFile = path.join(this.baseDir, this.TASKS_DIR, `${task.id}.json`)
await FileLock.withLock(taskFile, async () => {
  await fs.writeFile(taskFile, JSON.stringify(task, null, 2))
})
```

If `task.id` contains path traversal sequences like `../../../etc/passwd`, it could lead to unauthorized file access.

**Recommendation:**
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs used in file paths
- Use a whitelist approach for allowed characters in IDs
- Implement path canonicalization checks

### 2. Unsafe JSON Parsing Without Size Limits

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files Affected:** All files using JSON.parse

**Description:**
JSON parsing is performed without size limits, which could lead to DoS attacks through large JSON payloads causing memory exhaustion.

**Example in persistent-state.ts:**
```typescript
// Line 241
const task = JSON.parse(data)
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement size limits before parsing JSON
- Use streaming JSON parsers for large files
- Add try-catch blocks with proper error handling

## High Severity Issues

### 3. Race Conditions in File Locking Mechanism

**Severity:** HIGH  
**File Affected:** `file-lock.ts`

**Description:**
The file locking implementation has several race condition vulnerabilities:

1. Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in lock acquisition
2. Stale lock detection based on timestamps could be bypassed
3. No atomic operations for lock creation/deletion

**Example:**
```typescript
// Lines 31-35
const existingLock = this.locks.get(lockKey)
if (existingLock && existingLock.timestamp && Date.now() - existingLock.timestamp > timeout) {
  console.warn(`Removing stale lock for ${filePath} (age: ${Date.now() - existingLock.timestamp}ms)`)
  this.locks.delete(lockKey)
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Use OS-level file locking mechanisms (flock)
- Implement proper mutex with atomic operations
- Add process ID validation for lock ownership

### 4. Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs

**Severity:** HIGH  
**File Affected:** `persistent-logger.ts`

**Description:**
The logger indiscriminately logs all data without filtering sensitive information. This could lead to exposure of:
- API keys
- User credentials
- Personal information
- System paths

**Example:**
```typescript
// Lines 171-179
async logError(error: Error, context?: any): Promise<void> {
  await this.log({
    type: 'error',
    category: error.name || 'UnknownError',
    data: {
      message: error.message,
      stack: error.stack,
      context // This could contain sensitive data
    }
  })
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement sensitive data filtering
- Add data classification levels
- Use structured logging with field-level redaction

## Medium Severity Issues

### 5. Missing File Permission Validation

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Files Affected:** All file operation modules

**Description:**
File operations don't check or set appropriate permissions, potentially creating world-readable files containing sensitive data.

**Recommendation:**
- Set restrictive file permissions (600 or 640)
- Validate permissions before reading sensitive files
- Use umask settings appropriately

### 6. Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Files Affected:** `persistent-state.ts`, `persistent-logger.ts`

**Description:**
Several areas could lead to resource exhaustion:
1. Unlimited cache growth in memory
2. No limits on snapshot creation
3. Unbounded write queues

**Example:**
```typescript
// persistent-state.ts - Caches grow without bounds
private tasksCache: Map<string, Task> = new Map()
private taskOutputsCache: Map<string, TaskOutput[]> = new Map()
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement LRU caches with size limits
- Add queue size limits with back-pressure
- Monitor and limit disk usage

### 7. Injection Vulnerabilities in Shell Commands

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Context:** While not directly in the audited files, the system uses git commands

**Description:**
Git operations may use unescaped user input in shell commands, leading to command injection.

**Recommendation:**
- Use parameterized commands
- Escape all shell arguments
- Use Git libraries instead of shell commands

## Low Severity Issues

### 8. Missing Input Validation for Dates

**Severity:** LOW  
**Files Affected:** `persistent-state.ts`, `persistent-logger.ts`

**Description:**
Date parsing doesn't validate input, potentially leading to invalid date objects.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Line 244
task.createdAt = new Date(task.createdAt)
```

**Recommendation:**
- Validate date strings before parsing
- Handle invalid date scenarios
- Use ISO 8601 format consistently

### 9. Predictable Temporary File Names

**Severity:** LOW  
**File Affected:** `file-recovery.ts`

**Description:**
Temporary file names use predictable patterns with timestamps.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Line 63
const tempPath = `${filePath}.tmp.${Date.now()}.${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`
```

**Recommendation:**
- Use cryptographically secure random values
- Create temp files in secure directories only

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Security Headers and Configuration
- Implement Content Security Policy for web endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting

### 2. Audit Logging
- Log all security-relevant events
- Implement tamper-proof audit trails
- Regular log analysis

### 3. Error Handling
- Don't expose internal errors to users
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors securely

### 4. Testing
- Add security-focused unit tests
- Perform regular penetration testing
- Implement fuzzing for input validation

### 5. Dependencies
- Regular security updates
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Use npm audit regularly

## Conclusion

The persistent file implementation has several security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. The most critical issues are path traversal vulnerabilities and unsafe JSON parsing. Implementing the recommended fixes will significantly improve the security posture of the system.

Priority should be given to:
1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Proper file locking mechanisms
3. Sensitive data protection
4. Resource limits

Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to ensure ongoing security.
