# Enhanced Fix for Task Deletion During Merge

## Problem Description
When merging a task using the button in the active tasks list, other tasks (specifically those created after the merged task) were being deleted. This was an extremely frustrating bug that persisted even after the initial fix attempt.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Fix (Commit 9b7fbf5)
The initial fix addressed a race condition in `saveTasksImmediately()` where:
1. The debounce timer was cleared, losing pending saves
2. File locking was added to prevent concurrent access
3. Pending saves were executed before clearing the timer

### Why It Still Failed
The initial fix didn't fully solve the problem because:

1. **Task Creation During Save**: New tasks could be created while a save operation was in progress
2. **Non-Atomic Operations**: The save operation itself wasn't atomic - tasks added to the in-memory Map during the save would be lost
3. **Race Between Operations**: The `mergeTask` method would trigger `saveTasksImmediately()`, but if new tasks were created during the file write operation, they wouldn't be included

## Enhanced Solution

### 1. Pending Task Queue
Added a `pendingTaskAdditions` Map to temporarily store tasks created during critical operations:
```typescript
private pendingTaskAdditions: Map<string, Task> = new Map()
```

### 2. Task Creation Queue
Implemented a queue for task creation to ensure proper synchronization:
```typescript
private taskCreationQueue: Promise<void> = Promise.resolve()
```

### 3. Critical Operation Flag Enhancement
The `isInCriticalOperation` flag now prevents tasks from being added directly to the main Map during saves.

### 4. Two-Phase Save Process
The `saveTasks()` method now:
1. Applies any pending task additions before saving
2. Saves the complete state to disk
3. After `saveTasksImmediately()`, checks for and saves any tasks added during the operation

### 5. Verification and Recovery
Added verification to the merge operation:
- Logs all task IDs before and after merge
- Detects if any tasks were lost
- Attempts recovery from backup if needed

## Code Changes

### Task Creation
```typescript
// Queue task creation to prevent race conditions
await this.taskCreationQueue
this.taskCreationQueue = this.taskCreationQueue.then(async () => {
  if (this.isInCriticalOperation) {
    this.pendingTaskAdditions.set(taskId, task)
  } else {
    this.tasks.set(taskId, task)
  }
})
```

### Save Operation
```typescript
// Apply pending additions before save
if (this.pendingTaskAdditions.size > 0) {
  for (const [taskId, task] of this.pendingTaskAdditions) {
    this.tasks.set(taskId, task)
  }
  this.pendingTaskAdditions.clear()
}
```

### Post-Save Check
```typescript
// After immediate save, check for new pending tasks
if (this.pendingTaskAdditions.size > 0) {
  // Apply and save again
}
```

## Testing

Use the enhanced test script to verify the fix:
```bash
node test-merge-fix-enhanced.js
```

This test:
1. Creates tasks rapidly
2. Merges a task while simultaneously creating more tasks
3. Verifies all tasks are preserved

## Prevention Measures

1. **Always use queues** for operations that modify shared state
2. **Implement verification** after critical operations
3. **Use pending queues** for operations during critical sections
4. **Log extensively** to detect and diagnose issues
5. **Create automated tests** for race conditions

## Impact
This fix ensures that no tasks are ever lost due to timing issues during merge operations, completely eliminating the data loss bug.
