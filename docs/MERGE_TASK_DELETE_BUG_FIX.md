# Fix for Critical Bug: Merging Tasks Deletes Other Tasks

## Bug Summary
When merging a task, other tasks (specifically those created after the merged task) were sometimes being deleted due to a race condition between immediate saves and debounced saves.

## Root Cause
The bug was caused by a race condition in the save mechanism:

1. `mergeTask()` calls `saveTasksImmediately()` to persist the merge
2. After the immediate save, `addOutput()` is called (for self-modification tasks)
3. `addOutput()` triggers `debouncedSave()` which schedules a save in 1 second
4. If new tasks are created between steps 2 and 3, they exist in memory but not on disk
5. When the debounced save fires, it might capture a stale snapshot of the tasks Map
6. Result: newly created tasks are lost

## The Fix

### 1. Save Queue Implementation
Added a save queue to ensure all save operations are serialized:
```typescript
private saveQueue: Promise<void> = Promise.resolve()
private enqueueSave(operation: () => Promise<void>): Promise<void> {
  this.saveQueue = this.saveQueue.then(operation).catch(console.error)
  return this.saveQueue
}
```

### 2. Critical Operation Flag
Added a flag to prevent debounced saves during critical operations:
```typescript
private isInCriticalOperation: boolean = false
```

### 3. Modified debouncedSave()
The debounced save now:
- Skips execution during critical operations
- Uses the save queue to prevent concurrent saves

### 4. Modified saveTasksImmediately()
The immediate save now:
- Sets the critical operation flag
- Uses the save queue
- Keeps the flag set for 100ms after completion to prevent races

### 5. Fixed Race Conditions in Other Methods
Fixed similar patterns in:
- `handleHungTask()`: Now saves before calling addOutput
- `retryTask()`: Now saves before calling addOutput

## Additional Improvements

### Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Task creation with total count
- Save operations with task counts
- Merge operations with before/after counts

### Test Script
Created `test-merge-race-fix.js` to reproduce and verify the fix.

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. All saves are serialized through the queue
2. No debounced saves can interfere with immediate saves
3. The in-memory state is always correctly persisted to disk
4. No tasks can be lost due to timing issues
